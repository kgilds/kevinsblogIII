I discovered the [todotxt-mode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davraamides.todotxt-mode) Visual Studio Code extension. This extension is the closest to [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) I have found without having emacs.

My best TODO System was a text file; somehow, I moved away from it. This extension is critical to bringing me back to using text files.
