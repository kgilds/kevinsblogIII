# Introduction

```{r library, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

> Yikes, I need to subset with base R ðŸ˜…

 I blog to help me remember things for future me so here we go. ðŸ¤  
 
Rarely are we presented with a raw data that is ready for analysis. See this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) regarding data wrangling.  This post will demonstrate techniques for subseting with the tidyverse and base R.


Here is an example with the tidyverse using the mtcars dataset. 

With [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) the emphasis is on verbs ie., `select` to boss the computer and select the columns of interest. 

```{r dplyr-example}
head(mtcars)

mtcars %>% dplyr::select(1:3)

mtcars %>% dplyr::select(mpg, cyl, disp)
```




### Some base R

Base R: Subset the first 3 columns

Sometimes, I like to index the column selections.

```{r base-r}

mtcars[, c(1:3)]

```

Key points:

-   Need to use brackets with the date frame up against the first bracket

-   Need the `c` function to grab multiple columns.

-   The `:` lets you select column 1 through 3

Sometimes, you need to name your columns---here it is important to quote the column names. Notice with dplyr you do not.

```{r base-r2}
mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]


```

## What if we want to write a function?

Below are examples with both dplyr and base R.

```{r tidyfun}

tidy_select <- function(df, col){
	df %>%
		dplyr::select({{col}}, cyl, disp)
		
}

```

```{r tidyexample}
tidy_select(mtcars, mpg)
```

```{r base-fun}

base_select <- function(df, col){
	df1 <- df[, c (col, "cyl", "disp")] #col is variable you pick cyl and disp is hard coded in
	df1
}


```

```{r base-example}
base_test <- base_select(mtcars, "mpg")

base_test
```

# Conclusion

Here is a [good resource](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/08/how-to-subset-a-data-frame-column-data-in-r/) for additional subseting needs. I hope this helps.
