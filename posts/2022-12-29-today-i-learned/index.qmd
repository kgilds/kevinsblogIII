## The problem

How have I not run into the problem of filtering multiple values. I was running through some scripts but could not find the solution.

## Solution:

I am pretty sure I found this on a stack overflow post

    dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(outcomes, 'something1|nextitem2|anotherthing3')) 

It worked and write this to remember!
