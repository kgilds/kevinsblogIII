Can I make an issue template in Gitlab!

Yes, I really needed an issue template and recalled this tweet

Been revamping some SOPs :: code review checklists. Learned about GitHub Issue templates which are awesome for this. Here's an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> specific one <a href="https://t.co/VN0mkmHjQ7">https://t.co/VN0mkmHjQ7</a> <a href="https://t.co/FvEpgHRCPL">pic.twitter.com/FvEpgHRCPL</a>

However, for this project I started using gitlab as I wanted to try the updated [gitlabr package](https://statnmap.github.io/gitlabr/). I found this [issue-templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html). The directions are okay, but I found that I had to use the web 'ide' to create the directory in the gitlab directory.

And like I figured, issue templates have been super helpful.
