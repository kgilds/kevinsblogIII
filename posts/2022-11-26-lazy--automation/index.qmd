I hate repetitive tasks and will hyper fixate on ways to automate my life. Sometimes they work out sometimes they don't.

I have spent my weekend working with Google Apps Scripts to automate my work life. I wrote a script to draft an email with information from a google sheet. I think I will set up an automatic case note that logs to a Google Drive folder.

This [post](https://www.labnol.org/code/19960-convert-html-to-pdf) shows how to convert an html document to a blob object and save in a file format.
