I just completed *I, Robot* by Isaac Asimov. This may have been my first science fiction book and I loved it.

What I loved about the book; is that is sociology.

Sociology in essence is the interplay of how human create and are shaped by social forces.

Think Chat GPT is it about your question and iterating and talking to the machine.
