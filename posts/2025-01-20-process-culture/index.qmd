More or less process needed?

This [post](https://seths.blog/2025/01/building-a-process-culture/?)eevie from Seth Godin has some key quotes for me to think about. At first, I thought it was a justification for process culture, but not exactly. There is more nuance in that being 100% focused on process may not produce breakthroughs, but an organization without any process will flame out.

> Process is the investment we make in inefficiency *now* to prevent errors from costing us *later*.

Godin provides the example of an emergency room; it is process-focused but not very efficient, but the system does not rely on good luck.
