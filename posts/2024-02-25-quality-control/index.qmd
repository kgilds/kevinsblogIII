I appreciate this [blog post](https://theevergreenempire.com/quality-control/) about quality control.

An important gist of the article is to not just have standards documented but to communicate and train on them.

Evergreen finishes her blog post with this sentence:

> Consistent high-quality work is a result of quality control measures.

My takeaway quality control needs to be a system/process.

While I personally utilize checklists, I am uncertain whether we are
effectively communicating and training our subcontractors on these
standards. The hope that this would create an effective feedback loop.
