I moved to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and not sure how I feel about it. I know how Blogdown and Hugo can be burdensome. I just kept waiting for things to break on me. I miss my add new post Addins but I guess I should just make it myself. I will slowly port over worthwhile post to this new version of the site.
