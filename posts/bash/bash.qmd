Using a bash script with Postgres database.

## Make it executable

`chomd +x <filename>`

At the top of the file add a shebang

`#!/bin/bash`

### Read Data from CSV File

The script below reads the csv file and reads

    cat courses.csv | while IFS="," read MAJOR COURSE
    do
      echo $MAJOR
    done

### Connect to Database

    PSQL="psql -X --username=freecodecamp --dbname=students --no-align --tuples-only -c"

### Database Variable

`MAJOR_ID=$($PSQL "<query_here>")`

`MAJOR_ID=$($PSQL "SELECT major_id FROM majors WHERE major='$MAJOR'")`

### Code Planning

I liked this approach of using comments as a place holder for what to do next.

    do
      # get major_id

      # if not found

      # insert major

      # get new major_id

      # get course_id

      # if not found

      # insert course

      # get new course_id

      # insert into majors_courses

    done
