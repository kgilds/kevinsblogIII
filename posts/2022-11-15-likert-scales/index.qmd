I have been thinking about [likert scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) and the best way to analyze them. I came across this [online book](https://bookdown.org/Rmadillo/likert/) by Dwight Barry.

The book reminded me of the [likert](https://github.com/jbryer/likert) package and to utilize the Mann-Whitney test. What I found interesting in his approach to visualization was that the numbers are visualized instead of the category labels. I have always plotted the category labels and making the graph too busy. Thinking out loud--it may be useful for me to plot by numbers but not my intended audience.  


Other resources I gave gather up over the past few days include the following:
