# Introduction

Today, I wanted to create reprex to show how I used a function to re-level factors in `r`.

My challenge was that I needed to read in some data and was getting an error when the reprex ran and I could not figure out the problem.

The reprex [website](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/reference/reprex.html) had the documentation I needed to re-group and resolve the issue.

I was not able to use the addin but called the function from the console and needed to use the `wd`="." argument.

# II Other Factor Stuff

A good video on generating crosstab reports in `R`.

A couple of interesting packages to check out

These looks like a promising data vis package [vtree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vtree/vignettes/vtree.html) and the [CGPFunctions](https://github.com/ibecav/CGPfunctions)
