I finished the html portion of the Web Design [course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) today. I spent about 2 hours over the last two days working on it. I want to be sure to reflect on what I learned from these courses and not just buzz through them.

News things I learned included the following html elements:

-   figure

-   figcaption

-   fieldset

Anchoring links and images is still a struggle and form elements is still a struggle. I look forward to the courses that focus on forms.
