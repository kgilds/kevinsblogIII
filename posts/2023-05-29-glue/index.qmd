This is how I had to get the meta data to work on my new Post Add in.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# build yaml core
  new_post_core <- c(
    "---",
    glue::glue('title: "{title}"'),
    "description: |",
    glue::glue('  {description}'),
    glue::glue("author: {author}"),
    glue::glue("date: {date}"),
    glue::glue("categories:"),
    glue::glue(' -{categories}')

  )
```
