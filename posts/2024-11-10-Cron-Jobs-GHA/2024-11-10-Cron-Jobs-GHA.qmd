I scheduled my first GHA with a cron job. The idea was to set it for 5:00 am every Sunday.

I was happy this morning that my GHA ran but was surprised that it ran early than expected. I realized that I need to factor in time zones and that my schedule was set for UTC. Claude A.I. was able to help me reset it for Eastern Standard time.
