  Making dates more difficult

## Dates are hard

I was making more difficult. I need to extract the month from dates submitted.

    test_date <- session_summary %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date)) %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(month = lubridate:: month(date, label = TRUE))

The worst is when the code runs and appears correct but is not.

Turns out I was making the process too difficult here is the code chunk that worked.

    play_session <- session_summary %>% 
      dplyr::mutate(new_date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>%
      dplyr::mutate(month = lubridate:: month(new_date, label = TRUE))

Maybe not optimized but it worked.

Until next time, cheers!
