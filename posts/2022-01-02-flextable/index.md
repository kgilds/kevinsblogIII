I am preparing to complete a report using [`officedown`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officedown-for-word.html) due at the end of the month. I was checking out the package out today and was happy to see I could at least open the output file in a *LibreOffice Writer*. I was worried about tables in the document but it looks like [`flextable`](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/) seems to produce great looking tables and seems pretty straightforward to implement.
