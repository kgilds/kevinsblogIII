Today I need to find a difference between two data frames. Actually, I had to split the data frame and find the difference between two survey entries.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## Create lists
df_list <- split(dupes, dupes$response_id)


### Split the list as save a data frame
df_1 <- as.tibble(df_list[1])

df_2 <- as.tibble(df_list[2])

```

```{r,eval=FALSE}


all.equal(df_1, df_2)
```

Compares the date frame and I could easily tell there were many differences between these two entries. If I had time I would use fake data. Here is the ðŸ“¦[documentation](http://web.mit.edu/r/current/lib/R/library/base/html/all.equal.html)
