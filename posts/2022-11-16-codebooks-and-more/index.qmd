The following is a great [post](https://cghlewis.com/blog/data_dictionary/) for data documentation and creating a data dictionary.

As I was starting to work on a data dictionary for a project, I discovered the `get_information_report` function from the [`pointblank`](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/reference/get_informant_report.html)\` package this morning. I love the output.
