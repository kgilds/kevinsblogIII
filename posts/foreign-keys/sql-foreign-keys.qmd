I have been working on a SQL certification course from Freecode Camp. The most important thing that I learned today was adding a Foreign Key to a table in Postgres.

It drives me batty not to use commas and appreciate the parantheses.

`ALTER TABLE <table_name> ADD FOREIGN KEY(<column_name>)`

`REFERENCES <referenced_table_name>(<referenced_column_name>);`
