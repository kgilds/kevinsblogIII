I found this [blog post](http://wafflebytes.blogspot.com/2017/06/google-script-create-calendar-events.html) to help me figure how to post dates in a spreadsheet to a Google Calendar.

Adding times can be tricky but I found putting the time in a 24:00 clock notation with no PM or AM labels works best.
