# TIL

It's true, I had an MS Access Question. I could not figure out my `Is Not Null` criteria was not working. This [post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/query-with-is-not-null-criteria-not-working/8f141b57-f548-46ea-b67b-03fcd4366b98) explained it what was happening and way to resolve it.

```{sql, eval= FALSE}


Len([Name_Full] & "")=0

```

In my case, I wanted to exclude the null values

```{sql, eval = FALSE}
Len([Name_Full] & "")>1
```
