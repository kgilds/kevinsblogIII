## Today  I remembered

I use the `case_when` function to clean up data entry issues and I was stumped for a bit when my common structure did not work.

I am prone to messing up a `case_when` statements but I was getting frustrated after a few failures and non helpful error messages. I isolated the problem down and realized the pattern is that the case_when statement was not working on ordinal level variables. I changed the data type of these variables to character and was back in business.

Check your data types when a function or script is not working as expected.
