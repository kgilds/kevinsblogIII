Craftsmanship--going deeper,Lesson 1. Avoiding the race to the bottom,No,"## Part 1:

The cheaper option is someone who just meets specs and does not seek to understand or go deeper into the work. They are cheaper because they are doing the bare minimum to get to the next gig. Maybe a task is simple and you don't need someone to go deeper in mowing the lawn.  However, even with mowing the lawn; you can tell when someone cares about the job they are doing.  Customers do not go out of their way to discuss their work when someone is just meeting spec. 

## Part 2: 

### Are you the same?
I am not the same-I work with clients to give them insights into their data and focus on how  program staff can focus on serving people and ***use data not fight it.*** .

### What am I doing not to be seen as cheaper?

I step out of the box frequently. Rather than sending a report in Word, I will send the report as a html document that is interactive. I will make interactive dashboards that can update reports based on site locations or grants. I do wonder if working at a full-time job may  make me seem as cheap alternative--I don't have any other clients?  I think my work is valued but not sure they know the skill that goes into the craft; they just like the output. 

### What feelings come up for you when you're answering these questions

Waves of impostor syndrome run through me. What am I doing tying to expand this? But I know, I love the craft of what I am doing and want to do more and hopefully help other people.

Lawn person: Word of mouth from neighbor. In Florida, a good lawn person is priceless, 

Photographer:  Personal knowledge of person. 

I have more experience hiring freelances for the nonprofit I work for. I look for prior experience in case management serving the elderly from local county government  Of course, we do updated background screens, but I want someone within the aging and disability network. They help our clients mange their own care and keep within boundaries.

The common thread so to speak is networks and word of mouth.   Thinking back, I was hired for my freelance gig because I was familiar with the agency.  Ha, I just need to get them to talk to other people.

What are you doing with that data?,Lesson 3. The client you wish you had,No,"# A client you will never work with again
I have not encountered this yet but I have sense for this. A client that can't answer how they are going use the data I am capturing and reporting for them. A big red flag emerges when things are just done for grant compliance or with an answer-because we have to.

# The best client you've had
Like Seth has pointed out-- a client that pushes you to do your best work. And interesting  sidenote--is that if you are providing service for an organization you have to find the right product manager or staff person. My freelance projects took a turn for the better when another staff member took over a role. She would ask good questions and provided me more opportunities for expanded work. She wanted to use the data to better serve her clients.

# A client someone else has; you wish you had
I am at the bottom feeding on scraps. Large nonprofits with budgets are hiring established research firms to conduct analysis. They might be better at completing a one time analysis however I am not sure they are better at teaching the organization how to collect, manage and report their data on their own.  How many nonprofit organizations want this? In the data science realm, I am a beginner but a nonprofit professional applying data science and helping nonprofits set up infrastructure to collect and report on data--that is unique. Note to self, it may be beneficial to join American Evaluation Association and join a working group of independent consultants--I think they have this group.


# Section 2

## Are there good clients

I suspect there are good clients and there will be an emerging market for evaluation and need to make sense of data. I don't encounter many people doing nonprofit  evaluation. Most of the  evaluation consultants, I have worked with provide overviews but not in the weeds; how are we going to solve this problem.  Good clients want to use data to better serve their clients and there is some sort of friction in obtaining the data they need. The issue is that that they don't know who to turn to solve this problem so they continue with the status quo. 

### Sending signals
I think a good way to signal is through a website.  Identify through blog post the problem and signal I can help with this. I  highlight applications but I may not be doing a good job conveying how I may be able to help an organization solve a particular problem. Currently my website is more personal and does not convey that I am for hire. An issue I face is that I have grown my freelance work but to the point of replacing my full time gig.  So there is the issue of commitment. I think another way to signal from other analyst is to convey that the analysis will be done through code rather than spreadsheet. This makes the analysis reproducible and provides opportunities for interactive dashboard and reports.

## Screening Methods
My screening method would be to determine how they are going to use the data; how are they using the data or why do they want the problem solved I would also screen for determining if the are  determined to stick with only spreadsheets and reports in Word.  Maybe we would work together but it may not be a good fit.

crafmanship zen,Lesson 4. Five levels of freelancers,No,"
## What level of freelancer work are you doing most often?
The level of freelance work I am working at is craftmanship.  Thinking back I started as a handyman as I was available for cheap. I have been able to increase my skills and obtain more work and move to the craftmanship realm.

## What level of freelancer do you want to be more often?
I am shooting for remarkable level.  I want the client to pass this application or report to another organization and for them to say we need to hire this person.  


## At what level do you feel most comfortable? 
Craftmanship for sure; I will automate anything  that becomes mundane or mechanic turk like tasks.

### What level does it feel like you’ll never reach?
Unique and remarkable seem so far away but all you can do is try to get closer and closer.

### What are the obstacles and opportunities to reaching each level for you?
There are amazing opportunities to increase skills in R and Shiny. Working to get certified in Shiny framework. This will help me continue to grow.  


### What resources will you need to move up?
Time, experience, and  mentorship.

### How can you honestly figure out what level you’re actually on?
This is an interesting question. Can you answer this question on your own without feedback from clients and public. I suspect one has to be authentic and not be to caught up in chasing a shiny object. My strategy is  to identify what may be needed and scaffle up to deliver. Will this be enough to considered unique and remarkable--all you can do you drive toward this road. I am curious what @farid and @oleg may think about this.   

### Which level are the freelancers you admire working on?
I lookup to the unique and remarkable because they are able to craft their tools to deliver what is needed. They solve a problem that takes into account all the details and the big-picture. They can use tools and craft their own tools

### How much time and energy do you estimate you’d needed to change levels?
I am about three away if I can keep up with my rate of improvement. 
### Is there anything specific holding you up?
Time....but I make use of what I have.

Conversing..........,Lesson 6. Merit and fear,No,"### Prompt


**Talent**

What do I believe my work is worth?


_imposter:_
> Your work is average and pedestrian and most likely not of any value to other organizations.

_kevin_
>  I am not so sure this is true; the organizations I have worked and served collect and manage data in less than optimal ways. They are busy serving people and that is their focus-- not on data methods.

**Fear**
### What are my fears?
_imposter_
>  You are never going to pick up another client; your current client will not renew; you will never be able to freelance full time.


_kevin_

**That would suck; but you are still in the game: focus and finish, improve your craft to such they can't ignore you.**


**Skill*

## What are the skills I’m good at?

_kevin_

 * Designing data pipelines
     *   Creation of data collection tools in Qualtrics, Survey Monkey, Google Forms etc
     *   Processing the data through SQl, R, spreadsheet functions
           *Create functions to automate standards processing tasks
     *   Reporting the data through html reports,  Web Applications--Shiny Application, Shiny Dashboards



_imposter_

> Recall you are not great at regular expressions; 

_Kevin_ 

 you can work around this; you can use use stackoverflow; you don't have to fold up shop over this.



### What have I mastered?

_kevin_

There is always room for growth but  the creation of data tools, and data processing are pretty well mastered.

### What are the skills I’m developing?

_kevin_
 A loft of growth opportunities and value for me are in the web development--Shiny Applications.
 I can also stylize my reports to make them more unique.

_imposter_
> You are never going to figure out how to do this.

_kevin_: 
> You may be right but I have lots of examples of eventually figuring things out.  In fact, I have blog post that document many successes of overcoming challenges.

_imposter_: 
> Yeah, but it took you nearly a year and half to figure out how to implement parameterized reports in Rmarkdown.

_kevin_
> imposter that was not the question; you said I would never figure this new thing out . I did not convey it would be easy and could do this in an hour. For the longest time, I could not figure out how to write a function in R but one day I could and now I can't stop writing them. 


### If someone wanted to hire a freelancer in the top 5%, are you on that list? How do you know?

_imposter_

> You are not in the top 5% in any of these skills

_kevin_

> true, but I am in the top 5% for my client. I have the subject domain expertise to apply the skills above to their problem.  

**Talent**
Am I talented?
(And if the rest is skill, how am I earning more of it?)

I like to think I am talented with empathy and systems thinking.
I love to learn and see how I can improve the data service to my clients.

increase style,Lesson 7. Money is a story,No,"**Part 1: A client you will never work with again**

#### Story about money

They want a specified result and want to pay the minimum amount of money

#### What bucket did they put you in

They put me in handiperson's bucket.  They just wanted something done.

#### What signals were they  looking for related to price

They wanted to know how low I would be willing to work for. 

#### How much do they spend on the kind of work you do.

I am not sure what their budget was for evaluation services; somewhat limited as it would need to be a proportion of grant. 

**Part 2: The best client you’ve had**

* What’s their story about money?'
They were looking forward to a strategic partnership and wanted to better harness their data.
* What bucket did they put you in?
A crafsperson- they were engaged; appreciated the work asked for features that challenged me to do better work. 
* What signals are they looking for related to price?
They were looking for competency and ability to process data quickly and present the data. 
* How much do they spend on the kind of work you do?
They don't hire anyone else to do what I do. 

**Part 3: A client someone else has you wish you had**

* What’s their story about money?
They would be happy to pay a freelancer as opposed to paying a staff person to process data.
* What bucket did they put you in?
A craftsperson
* What signals are they looking for related to price?
They may be concerned that the service will cost them too much money; they will want to know they are getting quality work and service for a price they can afford.  They probably don't have priors purchasing this service; or other people handled the hiriing process. 
* How much do they spend on the kind of work you do?
They are typically hiring a person directly, or a big foundation is completing the evaluation for them so it is not always clear to me what their budget is.

Do you want to charge more for your work? And if so, what’s holding you back?
Yes,  and it their and my story about money that is holding me back. I like the cause and I am able to develop my craft while making some extra money.   My set up fee was okay but feel I need to increase my maintenance fee; I need to find a good ratio of pay to the amount  of work I am putting in on a monthly basis.  I have a bit more leverage then I utilize and I suspect they have a bigger budget to spend on this based on my per day cost over a quarter; even if i only spend 20 days a month  working for them they are getting a bargain. 

### And finally, what would have to change about your work (in the broadest sense) for it to be seen as worth it? 

I can give my work some more style-- a signature to so speak; I can improve in styling reports to mirror what a large foundation would produce.

## I don’t do
Fixing spreadsheets for people or clients
Analysis with a spreadsheet. I pick and craft the tools for an analysis.
Grant proposals--good partnership opportunities

Work without scope and understanding what the big pictures is. This is done through a service provider agreement. I will do some grunt work if it moves a broader goal forward. No grunt work for the sake of grunt work. 
Work where the other party is not engaged and just wants a result to check off. 

**Part 2: Who will you refer to?**
When the mismatched client or the mismatched gig arrives, who do you refer the business to? Make a list of all the possibilities.

* Projects that require advanced statistical modeling > American Evaluation Association,
* Grant proposals/Fundraising/Nonprofit management > Liz Wooten
* Other Evaluation projects American Evaluation Association 

I don't view those listed above as competitors. The top one is knowing the limitations of what I can provide. The second one consists of items that I am not interested in working on. Other evaluation projects--I need to find the others in Florida. 

The gap here is that I am focused on nonprofit evaluation work but there is some potential for general business analysis.

Write a response in the form of an e-mail reply to a client you’re saying no to the gig.

### The most probable rejection letter; I will write



Letter 1:
Thank you for contacting me regarding your evaluation challenge.  My assessment of your current data is that it is not feasible to meet the evaluation criteria set out in the grant requirements. 

I would be happy to discuss a proposal where I could help you design an evaluation of your program for future considerations.  


Thank you,

Letter  2: 
Thank you for contacting me about your data analysis problem. I appreciate the work you are doing in the community and want to make sure we get this correct. After reviewing your data, my recommendation is for a statistical analysis beyond the scope of my skills. 

My suggestion is to review [Find an Evaluator](https://www.eval.org/findanevaluator) page from the American Evaluation Association to help you find the best person for your needs.  If you have any future needs for processing and reporting data please reach out.

Hey @farid is there any interactions from past clients that you can build upon to make you unmistakable. Will it be your ability to listen and understand their needs. Is there a common tension identified from past clients where you can drill down some more or were there tensions unique to them.

"Sweet Relief | Status | Missing Me, Missing You",Lesson 10. Unmistakably you,No,"[quote=""lisaashburn, post:1, topic:31184""]
What I do is fairly well understood. Oftentimes, clients are relieved that:

* Someone is listening and taking time to accurately understand and capture their business processes, vision for the future, goals and unmet needs.
* An outside analyst (in some cases) is validating what they already know.
* Someone is translating between them and a software vendor or internal IT team.
* They are able to outsource communication and transfer the risk of *incomplete* communication or *unidentified* needs to another person, chiefly allocated to this work.
[/quote]

This is wonderful! You have hit on some key points that I have not previously articulated formally but had in my head.  My experience has been that often people in organizations don't even know where to start with the problem you articulated below. The ability to translate between the computer people and management has been key to my success.

I am a good at improving my technical skills. I will get better at helping my client use their data  to tell their story to stakeholders. This helps them get additional funding and making an impact. 

> My favorite football coach used to say get in there have some fun and get your nose bloody!

I will get better at convening the people in my industry. I will take some blows and be ignored but I will keep posting articles, will generate video casts, will keep teaching my point of view.  

I can find 10 extra hours in the week to devote to this. I am solidly booked in the day but I can carved out 10 extra hours a week in the evening to start. I am hoping this practice helps me improve my communication skills and increase my network of individuals.

What are you committed to doing to continue getting better clients?  A strength of mine is finding faster ways to automate data processing and methods to present data; this will give more time to help them tell a story with their data. 


How are you going to spend your time?

More time does not mean better; time allocation needs to be focused. [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) Committed deep work in the morning for 1-2 hours daily  Take a break from your work and be reflective about the work for the time to be useful. 
My rule is no social media on the phone and to limit to one hour a day on laptop. Keep to a schedule of being off a computer by 9:00 pm and read more.  Reading helps one more dots to connect. 

What are you not prepared to miss? Spending time playing with my kids and watching movies with my wife on the weekends.
