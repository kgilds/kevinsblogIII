I attended the 2024 National Self-Direction Conference this week. I brought my Chromebook, and I struggled to get to the "Captive Internet Portal. "

Quick internet search (using mobile) help me uncover this [page](https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/167146280/captive-portal-authorization?hl=en) with some helpful hints

Basically type in <http://neverssl.com/> and that prompts that captive portal to open. I had to use this trick while at the Airport on the return flight home.
