I was running into a issue of formatting a shiny application. In a tab panel, the content was running into the left margin. I asked Claude A.I and it gave me 3 options.

I chose the following and it worked like a charm. 

```{r eval=FALSE}

div(
    style = "margin: 20px;",     # Or use padding: 20px;
    # Your plots and tables here
  )

```
