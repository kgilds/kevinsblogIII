I am still lacking in direction but have settled to focus in on html/css. I can do some html but it is not second nature. I am going to be working through this [course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). I enjoy the structure of courses in that it helps you develop muscle memory.

I wanted to play with Docker but every time I start docker desktop it freezes my computer. I need to set some boundaries with Digital Ocean and setting up Droplets and work on Shiny Proxy.
