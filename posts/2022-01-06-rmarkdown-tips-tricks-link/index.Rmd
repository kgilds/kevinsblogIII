```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| message = FALSE,
#| 

library(tidyverse)
```


Here is a useful [post](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/r-markdown-tips-tricks-2-cleaning-up-your-code/). What caught my attention was this tip



Look at how the chunk options are presented. 

```{r plot-options, fig.caption = "This is a long caption that fits better inside of a code chunk"}
#| echo = TRUE,
#| message = FALSE,
#| fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6,
#| fig.caption = "This is a long caption that fits better inside of a code chunk"
#| fig.alt = "This is a long description that conveys the meaning of the visual."

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
