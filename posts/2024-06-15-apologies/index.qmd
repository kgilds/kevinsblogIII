I never thought too much about apologies other than it is something one should do if one messes up.

This [post](https://seths.blog/2024/06/the-half-apology/) provided insight for me.

Key takeaways:

An apology is a chance to reconnect.

> an opportunity to demonstrate to the person you care about that you see
> them, understand them, and are concerned enough to extend yourself.

I have had to receive and issue apologies this year.

Thankfully these elements of care were found in the apologies and it helps me re frame some of these experiences.
