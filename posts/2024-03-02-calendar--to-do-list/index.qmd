This is a useful [blog post](https://theevergreenempire.com/%f0%9f%91%af%e2%99%80%ef%b8%8f-calendar-to-do-list-%f0%9f%91%af%e2%99%80%ef%b8%8f/) about matching up one's calendar and to do list.

I appreciated the idea of doing this activity on a schedule thereby making it a process. Another takeaway it to identify opportunities to batch tasks.

### PS

I had Chat-GPT offer suggestions on my blog post. The response may have been too good. I did not feel comfortable posting as my work and it felt like stealing content idea. However, I think I may use it as a springboard. Here is the link to the output.
