I have been focused on github actions and gitlab pipelines for about two weeks, and I stumbled upon this [cool post](https://www.rostrum.blog/2021/04/14/gha-readme/). Not only is there good content on Github Actions, but content and script for the README is awesome. In addition, numerous posts on using automated workflows and other awesome content.
