I was working on new section of a Shiny Application and wanted to put two tables side by side without creating a new box within the tabpanel.

My random idea was just two insert a column function in the box; however, when I added the column I received an error. I added two columns but the tables were still stacking on top of each within the row. Clause AI suggested to wrap the two column in a fluidRow statement and it worked like a charm.

```{r eval=FALSE}


 fluidRow(  # Add this fluidRow
      column(
        width = 6,
        h3("Pre Outcome Site Report"),
        gt::gt_output(ns("pre_site_report_23"))
      ),
      
      column(
        width = 6,
        h3("Pre Process Site Report"),
        gt::gt_output(ns("pre_site_process_report_23"))
      )
    )  # Close the fluidRow
```
