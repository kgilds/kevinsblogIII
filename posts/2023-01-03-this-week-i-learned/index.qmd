My friend James wrote about [pancakes](https://turnercreative.ck.page/posts/the-first-pancake) and really he is talking about iteration.

How you have to flub up the first one to make the next one better but the point you have to have the first one to flub up. He provides a nice examples.

I also think there is something about getting into flow state or the concept of shitty first drafts.

When, I work on an analysis chart, table or blog post. I flub around at first and mess up the pancake.
