I liked this ([Post](https://seths.blog/2024/07/the-two-bicycle-errors/ "Link to post")). The insight is that we notice when someone is not very good or great at a skill. This may be overstated but there is some truth to it.

The same semantic applies when someone assumes someone was born to code or understands data.

> I can still feel the awkwardness of learning to codeâ€“it felt unnatural.

What is great about learning to code/how computers work there is a the flywheel effect in that once you understand something many concepts fall into place.
