I am hoping to still get there, but thus far I have learned a lot on the web scraping elements of my website and see some other possibilities. It will need a weekend post to illuminate more…………\nHowever, check out the README for this site."

My validation line states if the reactive value has less than 1 row the following message is displayed\n\nSorry, no data available.\n\nThis communicates to the program manager that surveys have not been entered yet. Most likely this is expected, but the message communicates that there is no data here to display.\nThe alternative to a validation statement is a blank graph canvas and a ugly error message with table the output.\n\n\nConclusion\nI was thinking of the validation function in terms of a practical tool but I see the importance of it as a communication tool as well. What I enjoy most about participating in the book club, is picking up detail and the opportunity for reflection."

    "text": "Once you see it; you can’t unsee it.🤔\n\nOne benefit of learning a new framework is that it gives you the opportunity to compare and contrast with an established mental model.\nI have been taking a Pandas Course from Kaggle and the lesson in Pandas involved establishing new variables in order to extract information from the data frame.\n\nindices = [0, 1, 10, 100]\nvar = ['country', 'province', 'region_1', 'region_2']\ndf = reviews.loc[indices, var]\n\nThis seemed like a pain in order to select certain rows and columns, but it did open my perspective to a challenge I was having.\nI have been working on reading data from a Qualtrics survey and there are nearly 147 columns and only about 117 are needed. (Long story on templated survey tools). To parse the data frame down, I had been using indexes for selections. Using an index is okay but frustrating as you are testing because the index selection breaks when there is a change to the survey. It was also a pain to write out all those terrible column names. The python script above made me think to create a vector to reference in a select statement.\n\nIs this possible–yes it is, and now I seem to see it everywhere.\n\nBelow is a minimal example with the ‘mtcars’ data set.\n\nremove <- mtcars %>%\n  dplyr::select(drat, wt, qsec)\n\nremove <- names(remove) #create a vector with the names of the columns you eventually want to exclude\n\n\nnew_mtcars <- mtcars %>%\n  dplyr::select(-all_of(remove))  #within the select statement us the helper 'all_of' with the - operator to deselect the vector of interest. \n\n\nnew_mtcars\n\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4           21.0   6 160.0 110  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag       21.0   6 160.0 110  0  1    4    4\nDatsun 710          22.8   4 108.0  93  1  1    4    1\nHornet 4 Drive      21.4   6 258.0 110  1  0    3    1\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175  0  0    3    2\nValiant             18.1   6 225.0 105  1  0    3    1\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245  0  0    3    4\nMerc 240D           24.4   4 146.7  62  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230            22.8   4 140.8  95  1  0    4    2\nMerc 280            19.2   6 167.6 123  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C           17.8   6 167.6 123  1  0    4    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230  0  0    3    4\nFiat 128            32.4   4  78.7  66  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic         30.4   4  75.7  52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla      33.9   4  71.1  65  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona       21.5   4 120.1  97  1  0    3    1\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175  0  0    3    2\nFiat X1-9           27.3   4  79.0  66  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2       26.0   4 120.3  91  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa        30.4   4  95.1 113  1  1    5    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264  0  1    5    4\nFerrari Dino        19.7   6 145.0 175  0  1    5    6\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335  0  1    5    8\nVolvo 142E          21.4   4 121.0 109  1  1    4    2\n\n\n\nConclusion\nLearning python helped me shake up my mental model and apply it to my R workflow."

The workshop consisted of viewing a video by Seth Godin, and responding to question prompts and tagging . The key was writing your response and tagging other people to receive feedback and vice-versa.\nAt the end of the workshop, participants were able to download their posts into a csv file.

I fell into my first freelancing gig and would love to do more.\n    2020-03-31 21:12:07\n2\nHi Razlan,\n\nI try to get the tough stuff done early while they are still asleep. We are fortunate that we have the flexibility to alternate care giving duties. The kids are also of the age where they are able to play together most of the time well enough. \n\nHang in there!\n    2020-03-31 23:53:03\n0\nThis is a great one; I let my former boss read and has not returned yet.... :upside_down_face:\n    2020-04-01 20:31:17\n3\nI am a huge fan of this podcast and blogging platform\n\nIt is from the creators of Basecamp.\n\nThe podcast:\nhttps://rework.fm/\n\nThe blogging/article platform\nhttps://m.signalvnoise.com/\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nI will use the tidytext package to break down the words in the post column and put it in a tidy format for analysis.\nLets take a peak\n\npost %>%\n  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, post)%>%\n   dplyr::count(word) %>% # count number of words produces n\n   dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>%\n   dplyr::filter(n >=150) %>%\n    gt::gt() %>%\n      tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Kevin's Top Words**\"),\n    subtitle = md(\"*The Freelance Workshop*\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Kevin's Top Words\n    \n    \n      The Freelance Workshop\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      word\n      n\n    \n  \n  \n    to\n415\n    the\n344\n    i\n342\n    and\n237\n    a\n209\n    you\n202\n    is\n173\n    of\n161\n    this\n150\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nNot very interesting, but we can clean this up! The tidytext package has loaded stop words to help us remove common words, and I am going to add words specific to the workshop.\n\nComplete an anti-join to remove standard stop words and add your own custom words you wish to dismiss\n\nBelow are my custom words:\n\nword <- c(\"topic\",\"quote\", \"post\", \"1\", \"https\", \"hey\", \"2\", \"homeroom5\", \"5\", \"3\", \"6\", \"_kevin_\", \"_imposter_\", \"34974\", \"you’re\")\n\nworkshop_stop <- data.frame(word)\n\nBelow we have a script that adds some additional data processing to extract insights from the words. I added a case_when statement to deal with similiar words and the anti-join statement to remove non insightful words\n\nword_count <- post %>%\n  tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, post ) %>% #breakdown each word of the character vector\n  dplyr::mutate(word  = case_when( #make \n      word == \"client\" ~ \"clients\",\n      TRUE ~(word)\n    )) %>%  \n  dplyr::anti_join(stop_words) %>% #remove standard common words\n    dplyr::anti_join(workshop_stop) %>% #remove words specifc to the workshop that are not of valle\n  dplyr::count(word) %>% # count number of words produces n\n   dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>%\n   dplyr::filter(n >=16) %>%\n  gt::gt () %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = md(\"**Kevin's Top Words**\"),\n    subtitle = md(\"*The Freelance Workshop*\")\n  )\n\nword_count\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Kevin's Top Words\n    \n    \n      The Freelance Workshop\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      word\n      n\n    \n  \n  \n    data\n83\n    clients\n66\n    time\n29\n    evaluation\n26\n    people\n23\n    skills\n18\n    farid\n17\n    process\n16\n    story\n16\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nNow we are in position to graph the data. Below is a graph of my most frequent words with a mimimum of 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for the graph is here:\nWhat were the most frequent post by category?\n\n\n\n\n\nCode for the graph is here:\nThis has been a basic introduction to text mining with R. It is possible to break down comments into their components. The most suprising word that stands out to me is time. It makes me want to re-read my post and understand the context better."
