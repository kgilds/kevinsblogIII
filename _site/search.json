What got me on this road was the discussion around the Drake/Targets Package.\nThe first time someone paid me to develop a Shiny Application the application was a beast with thousands of lines of code and awful to maintain.\nI tried using modules but this did not work out.\nThankfully, I was soon introduced to the Golem Package and started modularzing my applications."

The only roadblock I ran into is that I had not exported my modules and the testing engine could not find the server I was testing.\nI start with simple tests and work towards more complexity. My favorite basic tests is to count the number of columns. Here is the form:\ntestServer(mod_home_server, {\n\nexpect_equal(ncol(sites()), 4)\n\n})\n\ntestServer(mod_home_server, {\n\nexpect_equal(colnames(program()), c(\"time\", \"site\", \"grant\", \"id_code\"))\n\n})"
