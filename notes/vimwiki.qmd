I have recently been obsessed with Vimwiki and Taskwarrior. I may be 4 years behind the VImWiki wave. It has taken me more than a few blog posts and YouTube Videos set to get mine set up.

## Taskwarrior

Taskwarrior lets you manager your tasks from the command line

On the command line type task report and you can get the commands for all the different type of reports.
