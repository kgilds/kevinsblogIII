In a tab panel, the content was running into the left margin. I asked Claude A.I and it gave me 3 options.\n\nI chose the following and it worked like a charm. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndiv(\n    style = \"margin: 20px;\",     # Or use padding: 20px;\n    # Your plots and tables here\n  )\n```\n:::",
