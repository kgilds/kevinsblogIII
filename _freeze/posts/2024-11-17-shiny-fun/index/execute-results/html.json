I added two columns but the tables were still stacking. Clause AI suggested to wrap the two column in a fluidRow statement and it worked like a charm.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n fluidRow(  # Add this fluidRow\n      column(\n        width = 6,\n        h3(\"Pre Outcome Site Report\"),\n        gt::gt_output(ns(\"pre_site_report_23\"))\n      ),\n      \n      column(\n        width = 6,\n        h3(\"Pre Process Site Report\"),\n        gt::gt_output(ns(\"pre_site_process_report_23\"))\n      )\n    )  # Close the fluidRow\n```\n:::",
